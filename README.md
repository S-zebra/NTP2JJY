# NTP2JJY

This Android app is intended to synchronize radio clocks with your Android phone.

## Features
- Automatically syncs the time with NTP server (ntp.nict.jp).
- Plays tone sequence defined by the standard time station. The tones are not actually 40 or 60 kHz (supersonic), but high frequency distortion allows radio clocks to recieve them.
